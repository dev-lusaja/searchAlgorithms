SEQUENTIAL SEARCH
-----------------

It is used when the table is not ordered or can not be preordained. It is to seek comparing sequentially (hence its name) with each vector element to find, or until it reaches the final element. The existence can be secured when the element is located, but we can not guarantee the nonexistence until you have analyzed all elements of the vector.
